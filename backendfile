Create a Spring Boot project for a Social Media Application. 
Features should include:
1. User authentication (sign up, login) using JWT.
2. CRUD operations for posts (create, read, update, delete).
3. Ability for users to like and comment on posts.
4. Follow/unfollow functionality between users.
5. REST APIs for all the above features.
6. Use MongoDB for storing users, posts, comments, and relationships.
7. Implement WebSocket for real-time notifications (like when a user comments or likes a post).
8. Write clean code with layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository).
9. Add unit tests with JUnit and Mockito.
Generate the full project structure and code.
